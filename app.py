Quantify wherever possible.\n*Example: 'We delivered the project on time, received an A grade, and the project was selected for the college tech fest.'*\n\n---\n\n**💡 Pro Tips:**\n- Prepare 8-10 STAR stories covering different themes\n- Each story should be reusable across multiple questions\n- Focus on YOUR actions, not the team's\n- Always end with a positive result (even in failure stories, show what you learned)",
